# 🛡️ Solidity Vulnerabilities and Prevention Practices: 

## This repository is your guide to identifying and mitigating the most common vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts.

### 🚨 Here are the vulnerabilities covered in this repository:

- Reentrancy Attack 
- Incorrect Calculation 🔢
- Weak Access Control 🔒
- Overflow and Underflow ⚖️
- tx.origin Authentication Vulnerability 
- Insecure Randomness 🎲
- Downcasting Error 📉

### Getting Started
#### To start using this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Once downloaded, run `npm install` to install all the necessary packages.

### Setting up Testnet
#### To get your own Testnet head over to [BuildBear](https://buildbear.io/):
1. Create a Testnet on [BuildBear](https://buildbear.io/).
2. Copy the RPC from the Dashboard and add to the `hardhat.config.js` file.

### Contracts Deployment and Vulnerabilities Proof of Concept (POC)
#### You can find the contracts deployment and vulnerabilities Proof of Concept scripts in the scripts folder.

- To run the scripts, use the following command: `npx hardhat run scripts/fileName`
- For example: `npx hardhat run scripts/overflowandUnderflow.js`
